# WeatherAPI

Subject: Desarrollo de aplicaciones de Ciencia de Datos
Grade: Second of Data science
School: Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria
Name: VÃ­ctor Gil Bernal

## Functionality:

This code conects to an OpenWeather API with a 5 day forecast, takes the values for the next five days and inserts it in a SQLITE database.

When activated starts working at 12.00 and every six hours updates the values or inserts the next one related to the next day.

## Resources:

The development enviroment used in this project is IntelliJ and the database is SQLITE.

 ## Requirements

 To use this code it is neccessary to insert **two arguments** in the predict-provider's Main, the first one is the **apiKey** and the second one 
 with a **direction to a txt file** with the json of each locations. Here is the text to put in the file:

* {"name": "GranCanaria","lat": 28.1,"lon": -15.41}
* {"name": "Tenerife","lat": 28.46,"lon": -16.25}
* {"name": "Fuerteventura","lat": 28.2,"lon": -14.00}
* {"name": "Lanzarote","lat": 28.95,"lon": -13.76}
* {"name": "LaPalma","lat": 28.71,"lon": -17.9}
* {"name": "ElHierro","lat": 27.75,"lon": -18}
* {"name": "LaGomera","lat": 28.1,"lon": -17.11}
* {"name": "LaGraciosa","lat": 28.05,"lon": -15.44}

In the event-store-builder's Main it is only necessary **one argument**, which is the locaton of the database.

## Design:

The project has 2 model classes:
- Location: consists on the coordinates in latitude, longitude and the name of the region.
- Weather: temperature, rain probabilty, instant of the data, wind speed humidity, location and clouds

  Control models:
  - WeatherProvides: an interface with  a function that returns a list of five weathers.
  - OpenWeatherMapProvider: has two attributes, the apiKEY and the base URL, the function implemented from WeatherProvides takes two arguments, a location and an instant, connects to the database and reads the json, translating it into a Weather object and returning an array.
  - WeatherStore: an interface with two functions, saveWeather, that takes a Weather object and a Statement, and loadWeather that takes a Statement, a location and an instant.
  - SQLiteWeatherStore: implements WeatherStore, uses the functions saveWeather to connect to a database, and inserts or updates the weathers taken as arguments.
  - WeatherControl: Has a function called Execute that takes a direction to the database, it connects to OpenWeatherMapProvider to get an array of five weathers that inserts in the method saveWeather from SQLiteWeatherStore in a loop.
  - Main: starts working at 12.00 when activated, calls to the function Execute from WeatherControl every six hours.
